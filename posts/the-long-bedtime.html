<h3>how many dumb requirements are running your life?</h3>
<p>laying in bed for 12hours brought me some clarity.</p>
<p>
  "make requirements less wrong and dumb because all requirements are somewhat
  wrong and dumb, and then delete, delete, delete, delete"
</p>
<p>"question every requirement, document the person who made it"</p>
<p>"make requirement less dumb"</p>
<p>
  "question every requirement. all requirements are just recommendations and
  should be treated as such."

  The reason for enormous levels of stress were my outerworldly requirements...
  i thought I had to simultaneously: work 40hours, do full time uni in 2.5 years
  with 40 CTS a semester for first 3 semesters (i dont, i dont have to rush it,
  actually. i will still try because i dont know what else i would do. and i can
  even do it in japan. so i can go to japan earlier than after finishing uni.),
  go to the gym every day ( i can just do 3x a week), do führerschein, run
  business (do all programming, designing, filming, outreach, etc etc etc
  PERFECTLY) and spend time in japanese or i will forget the entire language or
  even worse, i will never find a time where i can fully immerse myself in
  japanese 100%. i need a girlfriend because i feel like im loning away at
  night, but i cant because i dont want to build myself up because i want to
  leave, but in order to leave i have to build myself up here :D
</p>
<p>
  But then the realisation.... there is no rush finishing uni(even though i dont
  mind working more to get it done earlier). i could even do it in japan.
  führerschein will be done in like 3 months. for business i can always pay for
  expertise. as long as i make 5k constantly with business, i can stop working
  40hrs (or any hours at all.) and if i strucutre my business in a way where i
  can run it remotely, i could be in japan in like 18 months.
</p>
<p>
  All it takes is making 5000€ consistently, remotely with my business. Thats
  all. Thats it man. All of your material needs are behind getting your company
  to 5k a month.
</p>
<p>
  Make your requirements less dumb. There was a simple, monetary solution there
  all along.
