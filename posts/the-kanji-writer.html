<h3>Are you the kanji writer?</h3>

<p>
  I remember a reddit post of someone that proudly presented their collection of
  tediously drawn / written out kanji. 40,000 did he manage to stack up. What an
  achievement!
</p>
<p>
  ... Except writing out has no impact on your retention (well not 100% true if
  you're actually training kanji writing recall but thats of no use to
  99.99999999999% of learners.)
</p>
<p>
  But writing out information we have in front of us just feels so good. its
  like making it yours but you didnt have to come up with it. what a great
  invention that is! except its just a waste of time. its a weird
  procrastination that really isnt, since you are putting in effort, its just a
  weird active-passive state thing.
</p>
<p>
  taking notes as you read through line by line & questions probably is
  effective. putting down everything is a fat waste of time.
</p>
<p>
  I will finish writing out
  https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/build?framework=remix since im half way
  through for the sake of finishing what i started but keeping in mind to never
  do that again. So I did learn something! Writing out should be for putting
  something down to free up brain capacity. In that sense I want to keep using
  the huge roll for exactly that purpose. every time i need to keep something in
  mind, put jot it down. In a sense it would have been really useful when i was
  going through graphlql & metafields just to note it all down on one huge
  paper. rather than bunch of paper scattered around.
</p>
<p>I have learned my lesson. Learn around and find out.</p>
<p>
  PS: also learned I can just keep my bed open and take naps mid-day w/ quieton
  earbuds in and just spam project/business -> sleep. thomas jefferson style.
</p>
<p>
  PPS: sascha, yamaguchimisa, risa and shizuka keep coming to mind. its all the
  ones that cared, i mean i saw them crying. i cant fucking waste time man
</p>
<p>
  Tying back 20 minutes later, I think this also is a reminder to just not be in
  a position where you can be put into weird situations. Like if I were in jp
  and my gf was like i wanna show you to my friends and i'm like no i dont like
  when people treat me like a monkey in a zoo and she keeps on insisting on it,
  i want to be able to be confident enough in my ability to get someone else so
  i can just say f*ck off, goodbye. art of the deal lol. i dont need anyone, but
  man do i want them! and you turn needy when you dont have options. and you
  have no options because you dont do shit. do shit. dont be the kanji writer
  dude.... no .. more!! (let me just finish this up and then NO MORE!!!)
  actionas actionas lets go mario
</p>
<p>if you waste your time youll get k*lled out there. at least spiritually.</p>
