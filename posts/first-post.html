<h3>Irritation</h3>
<p>
  I'm so irritated it's insane. I can't sit still. I want to wake up in a
  country I'm currently not residing it, I want to walk streets that are
  thousands of miles distant, I want to surrounded by a language nobody speaks
  around me, I want to make people proud that made my life easy. I want to eat
  the foods I have learned to love, I want to drink the tea I enjoy without fear
  of it running out.
</p>
<p>
  The only way is to stick your head in the sand and dont make any noise. If
  they find out I'm miserbale, I made a mistake. If I tell them things are
  better than they are, I made a mistake. I can't invite, I can't dismiss.
</p>
<p>
  I certainly notice that it seems to be all about me. Missing the entire
  picture that the only way out is by being useful to others in ways nobody is.

  Following a 0,000001% goal, requires 100000x action. You need to be at a point
  where it's unreasonable for them to reject you. You will end up and
  underexperienced 30 year old. Nobody respects you either way. You'd be happy
  if a golddigger ends up finding out your number and is desperate enough to
  show up. You have nothing but misery ahead. Enjoy your shitfest retard.
