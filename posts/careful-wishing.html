<h3>You want this.</h3>
<p>
  Initially I titled this "You wanted this" but that makes it sound like that
  wish is long gone but it isn't. I still want this, I just dont enjoy going
  through the shit. Wanting something and doing the things that are required to
  get it are two very different things. 静 keeps popping up in my head but its
  such a weird relationship. It's not like I could message her like yo my mental
  is down and I cant stop thinking about how great of a person you are LMOA.

  I want this. Right now its just cleaning off the trash of the playground. I
  can't even see the playing field right now, its covered in old gum and sticky
  substances. They need some real tough scrubbing until you can shoot some
  hoops. The game hasn't even begun yet, no wonder you dont enjoy it. There
  hasnt been any positive reward cycle implemented yet.
