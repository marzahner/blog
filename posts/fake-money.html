<h3>fake money</h3>
<p>its weird how you can find the best decisions in a pile of shyte.</p>
<p>
  getting a job in sales is really eye opening, and its no wonder people in
  sales end up becoming succesful enterpreneurs. it just breaks all washy
  believes we have around money and prices. in sales you just make shit numbers
  up and be like yeah thats the best we can do lmao
</p>
<p>
  working jobs in general have opened up the world to me in an understanding
  perspective. blessed to have some good noggins on me head to somehow get me
  into fortunate positions. i mean now i probably just got in because i have a
  really good last name and i went abroad for a year. cant make that sht up lmao
</p>
<p>
  didnt matter i dropped out of use 3!! times. never held a job for more than a
  year!! yet, gotten a chance.
</p>
<p>
  i still dont want to be in that country so yeah kinda sad but lets see how it
  goes, no clue.
