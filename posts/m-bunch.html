<h3>mürdürus bunch</h3>
<p>
  our oldest program thats running in our brains is to get rid of whats
  hindering ourselves from progressing in life. nothing is precious enough,
  nothing has our empathy when its in the way.
</p>
<p>
  in our recent decadent past we started to underestimate our capibility to
  mürder and the cruelty that lies within our species.
</p>
<p>
  single moms would rid themselves of their balast to increase their mating
  potential. families would get rid of the odd ones out. smaller tribes would
  take out the ones that behave abnormal. societies gossip until they convince
  themselves who is evil enough to sacrifice. some would take out the strong to
  increase their liklihood of surving, others would befriend them. some would
  surround themselves with weaklings that would offer themselves as canon
  fodder. some would rid the weaklings to have a stronger seeming tribe.
</p>
<p>biggest cause for human deletion is mürder by the most inner circle.</p>
<p>
  only recent past has put in mechanisms to prevent these occurances from
  happening at higher frequencies. it really is the achievement of recent past
  500 years.
</p>
<p>
  but its not permanent. its not written into nature. out nature is not that of
  caring for whats weak.
</p>
<p>
  realistically, if you take a look at post popular "protect the weak"
  movements, they seem like theyre the ones most ready for violence. really just
  taking it as an excuse to execute their natural programming - to shun &
  mürder. which is why you cant argue with them on the absurd irony of their
  position - their intent was based on something else all along.
</p>
<p>
  hence, once those systems are not maintained anymore, we will go back to the
  natural programming thats still prevelant in less prosperous areas.
</p>
<p>be weak and you will not be protected.</p>
<p>be strong and you will be targetted.</p>
<p>have everyone percieve you like them and you might not fall on the radar.</p>
<p>
  ideally you just put yourself in a position where you never play this game at
  all. i think this is what freedom is really about. you can just say "hey i
  didnt sign up for this, let me just take a couple steps away here" and never
  hear of it a 2nd time.
</p>
<p>
  play silly games, win silly prices. but unfortunately most people love playing
  them. so innvitably you will come across it.
</p>
<p>
  be kind, be a giver, never brag, give compliments, never own more than 1% of
  your worth. never forget everyone is a domesticated monster.
