<h3>only up</h3>
<p>you can start a project and have it fully up and running by the next day.</p>

  i've started this blog yesterday and creating new posts is already a breeze
  because i just created a small system around it. its not point and click type
  easy, but given the time spent vs what i got out, its pretty cool. creating
  posts is no big hurdle, ideally for just whipping it out and typing away. it
  serves its purpose.

  its kept so simple, even if it breaks you could just do it from scratch if you
  wanted to. thats how light you want to be on your feet. so agile you just
  glide.
