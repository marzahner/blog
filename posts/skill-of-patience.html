<h3>A fundamental skill I lack is patience</h3>
<p>"Patience is what you do in the meantime"</p>
<p>
  I dont have a good definition for it. Because being patient also means doing
  the thing you need to get done in order to get the thing you want,
  impatiently. There is no "doing something in the meantime"... rather, it's
  "doing the thing".
</p>
<p>
  Its like I keep getting this little bump in my head telling me to do sth else,
  break my work to do this other thing but it doesnt even dock on what I should
  do. It feels like a ping that says "become aware", "do something" but not
  giving a clear direction of what actually needs to be done.
</p>
<p>
  Its like it tells me to procratinate but there literally is nothing to
  procrastinate with. I got rid of it all.
</p>
<p>
  Well I didn't rid myself of it all. I could go some steps further but that
  would be really hard. I don't know how to go about logging out of Google but
  still having access to mail. I could just close chrome ðŸ¤¯
