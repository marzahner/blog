<h3>we fat we stupit</h3>
<p>with the event of proceeding technology we lose our own strengths.</p>
<p>
  with the evolution of transportation on demand and lifting machines we lose
  our ability to move and form the world.
</p>
<p>
  with the evolution of information technology on demand we lose our ability to
  connect and retrieve thoughts.
</p>
<p>
  with the evolution of companionship by demand, we lose our ability to go out
  and find acquitances.
</p>
<p>by becoming more powerful, we become weaker.</p>
