<h3>I had an appitchany...epiphany (googled)</h3>

<p>Maybe learning is all the same, just the reward cycles differ.</p>

<p>
  Given that I have learned Japanese to everyday proficiency, quiet recently
  too, means I can't be retarded. I just never learned something besides video
  games (that make it very easy with all kinds of reinforcement loops) to learn
  something to proficiency. Japanese was actually the only thing outside of it
  but still very adjacent due to the instantness of learning a single word and
  then randomly encountering it the very same day. Learning how to build a SaaS
  company is not the same.
</p>
<p>Business isn't instantly gratifying. Software isn't very forgiving.</p>
<p>
  I just carry this small spark of hope in me, that one day I will be rewarded
  for this. One day I will have enough profficiency, where I can turn this into
  a game. One day I can immerse myself the entire day without tiring out. One
  day it will open all the doors I have longed the keys for. That is why I go
  through it. I carry hope.
</p>
<p>
  At the very least, I will give myself a big payout for sticking with it. It
  may be silly, but I do long for nice things. A new phone (iPhone17), a nicer
  matress (a futon) and more comfortable ear plugs (quieton4)... realistically
  its all just to do even more in business. lol.
</p>
<p>
  Right now I'm not only learning all of the architecture, I'm also learning
  about delayed rewards. Certainly helpful for the degree I'm looking forward to
  as well.
</p>
<p>
  I just need to have find ways to squeeze in some movement as well. Maybe
  really go for a long walk 7-8pm? Ideally all time sitting is just well spent
  really. If I'm wasting, just get up.
